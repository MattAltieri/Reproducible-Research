# Reproducible Research - Concepts and Ideas
## Replication
- The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is replication of findings and conducting studies with independent
	- Investigators
	- Data
	- Analytical methods
	- Laboratories
	- Instruments
- Replication is particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

## What's Wrong with Replication?
- Some studies cannot be replicated
	- No time, opportunistic
	- No money
	- Unique
- Reproducible Research: Make analytic data and code available so that others may reproduce findings

## Why Do We Need Reproducible Research?
- New technologies are increasing data collection throughput; data are more complex and extremely high dimensional
- Existing databases can be merged into new "megadatabases"
- Computing power is greatly increased, allowing more sophisticated analyses
- For every field of study "X" there is a field "Computational X"

## Example: Reproducible Air Pollution and Health Research
- Estimating small (but important) health effects in the presence of much stronger signals
- Results inform substantial policy decisions, affect many stakeholders
	- EPA regulations can cost billions of dollars
- Complex statistical methods are needed and subjected to intense scrutiny
