# Evidence-based Data Analysis

## Replication and Reproducibility
##### Replication
- Focuses on the validity of the scientific claim
- "Is this claim true?"
- The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence
- New investigators, data, analytical methods, laboratories, instruments, etc.
- Particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

##### Reproducibility
- Focuses on the validity of the data analysis
- "Can we trust this analysis?"
- Arguably a minimum standard for any scientific study
- New investigators, same data, same methods
- Especially important when replication is impossible
